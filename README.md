## Getting Super Powers

![&#x8868;1 &#x79EF;&#x6781;&#x70B9;](.gitbook/assets/dsc_1472.JPG)

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process: $$a = b$$ 





```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
